## Introduction

Threats (risks that could exploit that weakness) , vulnerabilities (weakness in the system) and controls (securing the 

CIA triad - confidentiality, integrity and availability - authentication and non-repudiation are added too

Enlarging the scope from one device to many devices, users, and connections leads to the word “cyber.”



### Types of Controls 

- Physical controls stop or block an attack by using something
    – walls and fences
    – locks
    – (human) guards
    – sprinklers and other fire extinguishers
- Procedural or administrative controls use a command or agreement that requires or advises people how to act; for example,
    – laws, regulations
    – policies, procedures, guidelines
    – copyrights, patents
    – contracts, agreements
- Technical controls counter threats with technology (hardware or software), including
    – passwords
    – program or operating system access controls
    – network protocols
    – firewalls, intrusion detection systems
    – encryption
    – network traffic flow regulators
